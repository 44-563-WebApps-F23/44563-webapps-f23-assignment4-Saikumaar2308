    SOLNESS.

[Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:] Well, is
that you? <br>


KAIA. <br>

I merely wished to let you know that I have come.<br>


SOLNESS.<br>

Yes, yes, that's all right. Hasn't Ragnar come too? <br>


KAIA.<br>

No, not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is
coming presently to hear-- <br>


SOLNESS.<br>

How is the old man to-day?<br>


KAIA.<br>

Not well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed
to-day.<br>


SOLNESS.<br>

Why, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work. <br>
